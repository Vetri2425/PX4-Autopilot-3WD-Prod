/**
 * @file wheel_encoder_fusion.cpp
 * Fuses wheel-encoder velocity as a body-frame velocity observation.
 *
 * A differential-drive ground rover provides a body-X (forward) velocity from
 * its wheel speeds. This is fused via the existing body-frame velocity fuser,
 * which is rotation-aware (its Jacobian accounts for attitude states), so the
 * measurement is compared correctly against the NED state velocity regardless
 * of heading.
 *
 * In addition to the forward speed, a non-holonomic side-slip constraint is
 * applied by observing the body-lateral (body-Y) velocity as zero. The body-Z
 * axis is given a large variance so it does not meaningfully update the state.
 *
 * IMU lever arm: the fused state velocity (_state.vel) is referenced to the
 * IMU, not the body/axle origin the wheel encoders describe (see
 * output_predictor.h's getVelocity(), which subtracts this same offset to
 * report body-origin velocity). GNSS velocity, optical flow, and baro dynamic
 * pressure all correct their sensor's measurement for this same lever arm
 * before fusion (updateGnssVel() in gps_control.cpp, optical_flow_fusion.cpp,
 * baro_height_control.cpp). Without the equivalent correction here, a nonzero
 * EKF2_IMU_POS_X/Y and a real yaw rate during an in-place pivot produce a
 * genuine IMU-frame lateral velocity of omega x imu_pos_body that is nonzero
 * even though the vehicle isn't translating -- and the fixed zero-side-slip
 * constraint two lines below then fights that real term on every fusion
 * cycle for the whole pivot, biasing the velocity (and, through
 * velocity-position cross-covariance, the position) state. Confirmed against
 * field logs: the resulting position walk traces a circle of radius
 * ~= EKF2_IMU_POS_X as heading sweeps, not a random drift, and collapses when
 * EKF2_WENC_CTRL=0 or EKF2_IMU_POS_X=0.
 *
 * This is a secondary aid: it is only fused while another source is already
 * providing horizontal aiding (isHorizontalAidingActive()), so wheel encoders
 * never initialise the horizontal solution on their own.
 *
 * The rad/s -> m/s conversion (wheel radius) and the enable gating are handled
 * upstream in EKF2.cpp, which only pushes samples when fusion is enabled and a
 * valid wheel radius is configured. The buffer therefore only exists when the
 * feature is active.
